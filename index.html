      For each candidate look at how they're doing in the best rated general election poll against Trump from
      <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general">FiveThirtyEight</a>
      for each swing state.

      Use their favored poll percentage multiplied by the number of delegates
      for each swing state. Sum them and choose a winner.

        Date of the poll is not considered, just the ranking. In practice,
        most of the polls aren't moving significantly and aren't super old. If
        I get enough backlash I'll write some date parsing code (yuck).
